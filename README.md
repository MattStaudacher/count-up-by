## About

Count Up By
Create a program that takes two numbers - one to count to and another to determine what multiple to use to get there.

Here is some sample input:
Count to: 30
Count by: 5
Output: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30

Count to: 50
Count by: 7
Output: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49

Don't forget to consider how to handle any input that might be submitted:

empty values (user just presses enter)
non-numeric values (It may be helpful to read up about the numerical value, NaN)
negative numbers
count by number is larger than the count to numbers

## Technology Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, arrays
